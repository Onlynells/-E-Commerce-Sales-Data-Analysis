# -E-Commerce-Sales-Data-Analysis
#  Overview
This project analyzes an Amazon e-commerce dataset to extract insights on product sales, category performance, and the relationship between discounts, ratings, and sales.
# Dataset
The dataset contains information on various product categories, including rating counts, discount percentages and prices. Since no direct sales column was available, the total rating count was used as an estimate for sales.
Key Findings
# Top-Selling Product Categories
The five most sold product categories based on rating counts are:
1.Computers & Accessories- Accessories & Peripherals(5,079,477)
2.Electronics-Headphones, Earbuds & Accessories(4,844,658)
3.Electronics-Mobiles & Accessories(4,384,197)
4.Electronics-Home Theater, TV & Video(2,895,009)
5.Home & Kitchen-Kitchen & Home Appliances
(2,052,156)
# Correlation Analysis
1.Discount Percentage vs. Rating: Weak negative correlation (-0.1557), indicating that higher discounts tend to be associated with slightly lower ratings.
2.Discounted Price vs. Rating Count: Very weak negative correlation (-0.027261), suggesting that increasing discounted price has little to no effect on product engagement.
# Recommendations
1.Optimize Pricing & Discounts – Since discounts have a minor effect on ratings and sales, a strategic pricing model should be explored.
2.Focus on High-Performing Categories – Electronics and computer accessories dominate; marketing efforts should target these segments.
3.Investigate Other Sales Drivers – Customer reviews, brand perception, and product quality may have a stronger influence on consumer decisions.
